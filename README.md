1) This project consists of code for model development lifecycle simulation that can developers use for real-time problems.
2) Currently, this project uses salary prediction problem that uses mdlc simulation to execute all machine learning processes simply without writing any scropts for predictive analysis.
3) So, it works only for regression problems since mdlc simulation contains logic for linear regression only.
4) Here, MDLC is developed as a separate package that can be used for salary prediction later.
